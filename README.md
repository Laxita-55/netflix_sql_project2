## Overview
 The Netflix Data Analysis project involved performing end-to-end data analysis using SQL on a dataset containing information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix.

The project focused on data extraction, cleaning, aggregation, and trend analysis to derive insights related to content type, genres, release years, duration, and regional availability.

By writing optimized SQL queries, the analysis transformed raw Netflix data into structured insights that can support content strategy, market expansion decisions, and performance analysis.

This project strengthened my ability to use SQL for real-world analytical problem-solving and business-oriented data interpretation.


###Objective

Identify Genre and Category Trends
To extract and analyze genre-wise distribution using SQL queries to identify popular content categories.

Analyze Release Year Trends
To use SQL grouping and ordering to study how Netflix’s content additions have evolved over time.

Perform Regional Content Analysis
To analyze content availability across countries using SQL filters and grouping to understand global content distribution.

Analyze Duration and Seasons
To use SQL string and numeric functions to study movie durations and the number of seasons in TV shows.

Generate Actionable Business Insights
To convert SQL query outputs into insights that can help in understanding content strategy and platform growth patterns.
